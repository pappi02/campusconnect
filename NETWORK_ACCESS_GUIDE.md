3. Share the URLs with your network users

### Option 2: Manual Start
1. **Start Backend Server:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python manage.py runserver 172.16.223.198:8000
   ```

2. **Start Frontend Server:**
   ```bash

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Notes

- This configuration is for **local network development only**
- Do not use these settings in production
- Your website is only accessible within your local network
- External internet users cannot access it

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If users can't access the website:

1. **Check Windows Firewall:**
   - Go to Windows Defender Firewall
   - Allow Python and Node.js through firewall
   - Or temporarily disable firewall for testing

2. **Verify Network Connection:**
   - Ensure all devices are on the same network
   - Check if you can ping your IP: `ping 172.16.223.198`

3. **Check Server Status:**
   - Make sure both servers are running
   - Check for any error messages in the terminal

4. **Alternative IP Check:**
   - Your IP might change. Run `ipconfig` to get current IP
   - Update the configuration files if IP changed

## üì± Mobile Access

Mobile devices on the same network can access the website by:
1. Connecting to the same WiFi network
2. Opening browser and going to: `http://172.16.223.198:5173`

## üîÑ If Your IP Changes

If your computer gets a new IP address:
1. Run `ipconfig` to get the new IP
2. Update `backend/campus_delivery/settings.py`:
   - Update `ALLOWED_HOSTS`
   - Update `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
   - Update `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`
3. Update `frontend/vite.config.js`:
   - Update the proxy target URL
4. Update `frontend/.env`:
   - Update `VITE_API_BASE_URL`
5. Update `frontend/src/api.js`:
   - Update the fallback baseURL
6. Update `start_network_servers.bat` with new IP

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### "Failed to load data" Error
This usually means the API calls are not reaching the backend:

1. **Check if both servers are running:**
   - Backend should be at `http://172.16.223.198:8000`
   - Frontend should be at `http://172.16.223.198:5173`

2. **Test API directly:**
   - Try accessing `http://172.16.223.198:8000/api/products/` in browser
   - Should return JSON data, not an error

3. **Check Windows Firewall:**
   - Allow Python.exe and Node.js through Windows Firewall
   - Or temporarily disable firewall for testing

4. **Restart servers:**
   - Close both terminal windows
   - Run `start_network_servers.bat` again

### Network Users Can't Access
1. **Verify same network:** All devices must be on same WiFi/network
2. **Test connectivity:** From other device, try `ping 172.16.223.198`
3. **Check firewall:** Windows Firewall might be blocking connections
4. **Try different browser:** Sometimes browser cache causes issues

### API Calls Failing
1. **Check browser console:** Press F12 and look for error messages
2. **CORS errors:** Make sure CORS settings include your IP
3. **Network timeouts:** Increase timeout in `frontend/src/api.js`

## üéâ Success!

Your Campus Connect website is now available to everyone on your network! Share the URL `http://172.16.223.198:5173` with your friends, colleagues, or anyone on your local network.
