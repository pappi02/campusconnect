# Firebase Configuration Setup

## ðŸ”¥ Firebase Environment Variables

The Firebase error you're seeing is because the Firebase environment variables are not configured. Here's how to fix it:

## Option 1: Add Firebase Environment Variables (Recommended)

1. **Create or update `frontend/.env` file** with your Firebase config:
```env
# Network Configuration
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://172.16.223.198:8000

# Firebase Configuration (replace with your actual values)
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key-here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789:web:abcdef123456
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

## Option 2: Get Firebase Config from Firebase Console

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing project
3. Go to Project Settings > General
4. Scroll down to "Your apps" section
5. Click "Add app" and select Web (</>) 
6. Register your app and copy the config values
7. Add them to your `.env` file

## Option 3: Disable Firebase (Quick Fix)

If you don't need Firebase authentication, the current code will work fine with fallback authentication. The warning messages are harmless and won't affect your website functionality.

## âœ… Current Status

- âœ… Firebase errors are handled gracefully
- âœ… Website works without Firebase configuration
- âœ… Google/Facebook login will show warning but won't crash the app
- âœ… Regular email/password authentication works normally

## ðŸ”§ What Was Fixed

- Added fallback configuration for missing Firebase environment variables
- Added error handling to prevent app crashes
- Added graceful degradation when Firebase is not configured
- Firebase authentication features will be disabled but app continues to work

Your website will work perfectly for network access even without Firebase configuration!
